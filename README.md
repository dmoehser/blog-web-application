# Blog Web Application

A full-stack blog web application built with Node.js, Express, and EJS templating. Features CRUD operations for blog posts, responsive design, and a clean user interface for creating, editing, and managing blog content.

## What I built

✅ Full-stack blog application with Node.js and Express  
✅ EJS templating engine for dynamic content rendering  
✅ CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for blog posts  
✅ Responsive design with Bootstrap integration  
✅ Multiple pages (Home, About, Contact, Create, Edit)  
✅ Form handling and data validation  
✅ Dynamic routing with Express.js  
✅ Static file serving for CSS and assets  

## Technologies used

- **Node.js** - Server-side JavaScript runtime
- **Express.js** - Web application framework
- **EJS** - Embedded JavaScript templating
- **Bootstrap** - CSS framework for responsive design
- **HTML5** - Semantic markup and structure
- **CSS3** - Custom styling and responsive design

## Why I built this

I wanted to learn full-stack web development and understand how to build dynamic web applications. This project represents my progression from static HTML sites to interactive web applications with server-side logic and database-like functionality.

## What I learned

- Node.js server setup and configuration
- Express.js routing and middleware
- EJS templating and dynamic content rendering
- CRUD operations and data management
- Form handling and user input processing
- Server-side JavaScript programming
- Web application architecture
- HTTP methods (GET, POST) and RESTful design
- Static file serving and asset management

This project helped me understand the fundamentals of full-stack development and prepared me for more complex applications with databases and persistent data storage.
